        "\n",
        "When running a computer program, the computer needs to allocate memory for each instantiated object so that information can be stored, accessed, and possibly altered. Each allocation of memory occurs \"somewhere\", and the location is the address (or collection of addresses). Let us assume that an object is allocated a collection of memory addresses in memory to represent its values internally for later use. If one would like to copy this object, then there are two ways to do so: a deep copy and a shallow copy.\n",
        "\n",
        "The deep copy involves allocating an equivalently-sized collection of \"real estate\" in memory elsewhere from the original. Importantly, altering this new memory has no effect on the source from which is was copied from since the addresses in memory differ. This copy is \"deep\" since it invovles extracting and rewriting each attribute of the original object to a new location in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, a shallow copy involves creating a so-called \"pointer\" in memory that \"points\" to an address to say \"my information is stored there\". This means that altering the shallow-copied object will necessarily alter the object from which it was copied from since altering it involves changing the information that is pointed at, which is the source of the copy. This is shallow because instead of rewriting the information about the object it is simply referenced from another location in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "Assignment, in general, refers to assigning an object a collecton of memory to represent its information. If we loosely think of the memory which represents an object as a \"genome\", then a genome that cannot be mutated (altered from its original) is an \"immutable\" object, while a genome that can be mutated (altered from its original) is a \"mutable\" object. This is intuitively where the respective terminology comes from.\n",
